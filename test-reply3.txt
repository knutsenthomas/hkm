So a good approach to fix this right now would be:
1. Since we want all the sidebar items always visible and organized, we can use CSS to make sidebar categories visible always (overide the data-nav-category filter).
2. We can add some CSS pseudo-elements (like "Nettsted", "Kommunikasjon", "Administrasjon" min-headers) right into the sidebar dynamically or by editing the HTML, so the links are grouped under those titles in the sidebar. This makes it structured.
3. Remove the top horizontal menus ("Nettsted", "Kommunikasjon") entirely from the main views.
4. Remove the sub-horizontal menus ("Kontakter", "Segmenter", "Meldinger") entirely from the page headers so it's ONLY the sidebar.

Does that sound exactly like what you want?
